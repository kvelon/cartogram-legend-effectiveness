This method however involved a lot of guessing in terms of assumed size, however as mentioned before, the fact that the size of a cartogram is proportionate to the population, it made sense to assume fractions since majority of the population sizes were so large that a misestimation would not have made a huge difference. Especially when working with larger areas, a scale factor made more sense.","Much easier to predict, I would just count and estimate the grid lines, this became tiresome after a while however so I was less specific as time went on.
